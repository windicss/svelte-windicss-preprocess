# svelte-windicss-preprocess

A svelte preprocessor for [windicss](https://github.com/windicss/windicss). Windi CSS is a next generation utility-first CSS framework.

If you are already familiar with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), think about Windi CSS as an on-demanded alternative to Tailwind, which provides faster load times, fully compatible with Tailwind v2.0 and with a bunch of additional cool features.
